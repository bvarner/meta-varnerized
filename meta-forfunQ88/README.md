# meta-forfun-Q88 - A bitbake layer for inexpensive (Q88) android tablets.

Several years back my family handed me a ['piece of junk' tablet]() that they were given as a promotional stunt.
I've had it laying in a drawer for years, with ideas for what to use it for dancing in my head.

Building upon the [meta-sunxi] layer, and the mainline kernel (which now includes decent device trees for these devices), 
this layer aims to provide the necessary bits to get the kernel and devices all functioning.
